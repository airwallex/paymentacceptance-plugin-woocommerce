## POWER YOUR CHECKOUT WITH AIRWALLEX ONLINE PAYMENTS
Power your WooCommerce store checkout with Airwallex Online paymentsâ€™ multi-currency checkout, with its like-for-like settlement and 30+ payment methods, to get paid by your global customers in an easier, faster and more cost-effective way. 

See the [installation guide](https://www.airwallex.com/docs/online-payments__plugins__woocommerce__install-the-woocommerce-plugin) for how to install and configure this plugin. 

== WHY CHOOSE AIRWALLEX ==

#### Improve conversion by localizing your checkout experience, offering all the local payment methods that your customers use, and supporting multi-currency checkout
Airwallex allows your customers to pay you through all mainstream payment methods, including major card schemes (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, UnionPay), mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay, and 30+ local payment methods across APAC and Europe such as WeChat Pay & Alipay in China, iDeal, Bancontact, GiroPay and Sofort in Europe, and DANA and GrabPay in Southeast Asia.

#### Improve your profit margins by cutting out unnecessary fees by getting like-for-like settlement in 7+ currencies
Accept 100+ currencies and get like-for-like settlements in 7+ currencies, including USD, CAD, GBP, EUR and AUD, directly into your Airwallex multi-currency wallet. Avoid forced FX conversions to your home currency, and instead use the settled funds to pay for your SaaS subscriptions through Airwallex Borderless Cards, or your global suppliers using Airwallex Transfers. You can also convert these collections back to your home currency at very low FX rates with Airwallex.

#### Enable a faster checkout experience for repeat customers by saving their card details
Increase your checkout conversion by removing the friction of having your customers re-enter their card details when making repeat purchases. Now they can save their card number on file for faster future payments.
